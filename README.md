None are fully functional, and all created by a complete n00b.  

Created for LM 21 with cs_CZ locale and a single user, with no effort to make it compatible with other systems.  

A big portion of the scripts is stolen from other git repos and projects namely:
- [Rofi themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)
- [i3blocks scripts](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib)  
Fill free to get some inspiration or point out mistakes. Just **do not** expect everything to work perfectly.
## Dependencies (not including build tools and i3block dependences)

- i3-gaps
- polybar
- i3blocks
- qtile
